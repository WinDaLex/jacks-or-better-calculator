I'm playing a iOS game named "Tiny Tower Vegas". There is an interesting but complicated mini game in that. After searching on Google, I knew about the prototype of this game is a kind of video poker called "Jackers or Better".

For earning Tower Bux (the currency in the game) as many as possible XD, I decided to develop a calculator of "Jacker or Better".
